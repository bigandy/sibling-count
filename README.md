# Sibling-count Web Component

A web component that allows you to put --sibling-count on the parent item, as well as --sibling-index on each child item. This allows cool things such as https://nerdy.dev/cyclical-radio-group-with-trig-functions-and-grid but without the hard-work of hand-coding the css variables.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - runs the vite dev environment
- `npm run build` - builds the project with vite build
- `npm run npm:publish` - publishes the package to npm (needs One Time Password)
